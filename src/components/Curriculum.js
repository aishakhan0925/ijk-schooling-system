            <h3>(THE MONTESSORI SECTION)</h3>
            <p>
              At IJK‘s Montessori, we provide a wonderfully stimulating,
              supportive and happy leaning environment for our children. Our
              children learn through play and engage in adult-led and
              child-initiated activities. All children have opportunities to
              explore and investigate, developing their communicative and
              creative skills both indoors and outside. Our highly trained
              teachers engage and educate children on a daily basis through
              lesson plans based on their social, emotional, cognitive and
              physical development

            <h1>The Montessori Teacher at IJK</h1>
            <p>
              We are committed to maximising this stage by providing a skilled
              team and a child-centred curriculum that puts structured play at
              the heart of all we do. Initially the Montessori teacher carefully
              observes the children in her class to ascertain the development
              needs of each child. Then comes the task of preparing the
              environment and material to meet various need of the individual
              children within the group. As the child begins to make free
              choices, interact and discover the materials, the teacher
              facilitates their learning. The primary goal of the teacher is to
              foster and enhance each child’s natural sense of joy and wonder.

            <p>
              A Montessori classroom is carefully constructed to let the child
              work independently and allow for the joy of self-discovery.
              Teachers introduce materials and children are free to choose them
              again and again, working with them, discovering and ultimately
              mastering the ideas. The materials that we use are:

            <p>
              Children can attend JUNIOR MONTESSORI from the age of two. Our
              setting offers a supportive combination of care and early
              education. EPL exercises helps a lot to normalize a child and help
              him settle in a new environment. It provides a seamless transition
              to starting school. All children over the age of three* (subject
              to change) are entitled to 15 hours each week during term time,
              providing there are spaces in the sessions. A lunchtime session is
              also provided. A child starts scribbling, tracing patterns,
              coloring and identifying different colors in the early session
              .Later we start books which are then preceded by copies.
              Self-grooming sessions are also held on a regular basis. Students
              leaving this program emerge confident, creative and divergent in
              their thinking.

            <p>
              We believe that children benefit from home learning. We also
              believe that this should be offered in a way that doesn’t cause
              stress or cause difficulties at home. Teachers are aware that some
              pupils find homework very difficult so we ensure that there is
              time for children or parents to see your teacher if this is the
              case. Subjects such as reading, multiplication tables and spelling
              are areas that home can support at all times. Hearing your child
              read and encouraging them to practice their multiplication tables,
              are also important ways in which you can help your child with
              their learning.
